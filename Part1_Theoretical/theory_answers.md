**Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch Differences**
## TensorFlow:

Developed by Google, uses static computation graphs

Excellent production deployment capabilities

Strong visualization tools (TensorBoard)

Comprehensive ecosystem

## PyTorch:

Developed by Facebook, uses dynamic computation graphs

More pythonic and intuitive for research

Better debugging capabilities

Preferred for academic research

## When to choose:

TensorFlow: Production systems, mobile deployment, when using TFX ecosystem

PyTorch: Research projects, rapid prototyping, when dynamic graphs are needed

Q2: Jupyter Notebooks Use Cases
Exploratory Data Analysis: Interactive data visualization and statistical analysis

Model Prototyping: Quick iteration and experimentation with different architectures

**Q3: spaCy vs Basic String Operations**

spaCy provides:

Pre-trained models for various languages

Efficient tokenization and parsing

Named Entity Recognition capabilities

Dependency parsing and syntactic analysis

Word vectors and similarity comparisons

**Ethical Considerations**
## MNIST Model Biases:

Training data may lack diversity in handwriting styles

Cultural variations in digit writing not represented

Potential performance degradation on non-standard digits

## Mitigation Strategies:

Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators to analyze performance across subgroups

Data augmentation to include diverse writing styles

Regular bias auditing during model development
